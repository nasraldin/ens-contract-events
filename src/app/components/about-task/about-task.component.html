    Task Overview
  </h3>
  <p class="mb-0">
    We Need to investigate or list the ENS contract events of the past days. So,
    we will write a MVP (minimum viable product) DApp to get a list of the ENS
    contract events of the past (e.g. the last 1 or 2 days) focusing on the
    event for registered names.

    uint256 expires)

      ENS
    </h5>
    <p class="mb-0 ml-3">
      ENS is the Ethereum Name Service, a distributed, open, and extensible
      naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0 ml-3">
      The ENS offers a secure and decentralised way to address resources both on
      and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names.
    </p>
    <p class="ml-3">
      Detailed information you can find on the projectâ€™s internet page:

    <h5 class="ml-3">
      DApp
    </h5>
    <p class="mb-0 ml-3">
      A decentralized application (DApp, dApp, Dapp, or dapp) is a computer
      application that runs on a distributed computing system. DApps have been
      mostly popularized by distributed ledger technologies (DLT), namely the
      Ethereum Blockchain, where DApps are often referred to as smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p class="ml-3">
      DApps may run on top of distributed computing systems such as Ethereum or
      Bitcoin. Decentralized applications are stored on and executed by a
      Blockchain system.
    </p>

    <h5 class="ml-3">
      Ethereum address
    </h5>
    <p class="ml-3">
      Is simply a 64-character hex string generated subject to various rules
      defined in the Ethereum yellow paper.
    </p>

    <h5 class="ml-3">
      Smart Contract
    </h5>
    <p class="ml-3">
      A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate,
      verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract.

    Scope of Work
  </h3>
  <p class="mb-0">
    Display contract events for past 1,2 days in the table UI and can search,
    filter, sort events with pagination.

      Initially, we planned to implement this set of features to be simple yet
      useful:
    </p>
    <hr />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Store ABI, address, provider records in the json and load contract info
        within app initialize.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly switch between networks: Mainnet/Ropsten/etc or your own
        localhost testnet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Client app interact with smart contract and get past events from
        contract.
      </li>
      <li>User-friendly search within contract events</li>
      <li>Simple & short steps to view events</li>
      <li>Excellent performance</li>
    </ul>

        We use some of the DevOps principles for Continuous Integration (CI),
        Continuous Delivery (CD).
        <p>
          CD automates the release process building on the automated testing in
          CI so that new builds can be released at detecting staging prod
          release from repository pushed this will push to an azure pipeline to
          valid release and make sure the build is valid and tested for
          deploying to production
